One of the most difficult and critical choices of any business owner is locating their shop. In the restaurant business a good location is often a significant factor in the ability of the restaurant to make it and suceed. The goal of this project and analysis is to determine what locations within the city of Atlanta potentially offer a business owner the ideal location for a coffee shop targeting working adults_\n\nThis \"ideal\" location will be defined by a few critical factors: \n* Proximity to other coffee shops\n* Proximity to other restaurants \n* Proximity to offices to target working adults"
